This lab was actually the smoothest-going one for me out of the whole week! No problems, no buttons to push - all the shell commands worked and I ended up with what I was supposed to. Only issue if I could pick one out is sometimes forgetting the new commands/syntax but thats it. This was a welcome excersize, Im glad I finished now I can finish the MEN Stack CRUD Lab and then after that focus on Project2 ;)
